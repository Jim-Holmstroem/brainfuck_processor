Requirements
------------
* 8bit state
* Up/down countable
* Check if state is non-zero
* Enableable
* (Should it be clocked? consider ++)


Up/down 8-bit binary counter to hold the memory state and handle state changes. (Must also have enable pin)
8-input OR-gate for the non-zero check.

Investigation
-------------
* Asyncronous 8-bit counters is 0.7USD while syncronous is 10USD/piece. Can one use async ones?
